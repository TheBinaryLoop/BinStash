BinStash is a modern tool for efficiently storing build artifacts and release packages. It uses content-defined chunking, deduplication, and a custom binary format to dramatically reduce redundant storage, especially in CI/CD pipelines.

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
# 1. Setup your server with PostgreSQL and blob storage
# 2. Add a chunk store and repo
BinStash.Cli chunk-store add --name my-store --type Local --local-path /mnt/data
BinStash.Cli repo add --name my-repo --chunk-store <chunk-store-id>

# 3. Add your first release
BinStash.Cli release add -v 1.0.0 -r my-repo -f ./build_output
```

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 **FastCDC Chunking** — Configurable, content-defined chunking for optimized diffs.
- 💾 **Deduplication** — Chunk-based deduplication across all releases in the same store.
- 📦 **Custom Binary Format** — Delta-encoded, varint-packed, transpose-compressed metadata.
- 🪶 **Zstd Compression** — Transparent compression for both chunk data and metadata.
- 🔁 **Partial/Delta Downloads** — Download full releases, components, or deltas.
- 🧠 **Pack-Based Chunk Storage** — Efficient on-disk structure with indexed `.pack` files.

BinStash.Cli [options]
BinStash.Cli [command] [...]
```

- `chunk-store`: Add/list/show/delete chunk stores
- `repo`: Create/list repositories for organizing releases

## 🧱 Storage Internals

### 📂 Chunk Storage

- Chunks are stored in `.pack` files grouped by BLAKE3 prefix
- Each `.pack` entry includes:
    - Magic header (`BSCK`)
    - Compressed + uncompressed length
    - xxHash3 checksum
- An `.idx` file tracks chunk offset and length for fast reads
- Files rotate at 4 GiB for performance and portability

### 🧬 Release Format

`.rdef` files include:
- Transpose-compressed chunk table
- Tokenized component + file name strings
- Bit-packed delta chunk references
- Shared chunk lists with dedupe-aware lookup
- Zstd compression on all sections
